# InsightDataScienceCodeChallenge

The first part of the coding challenge is to implement your own version of Word Count that counts all the words from the text files contained in a directory named wc_input and outputs the counts (in alphabetical order) to a file named wc_result.txt,which is placed in a directory named wc_output.

Another common problem is the Running Median - which keeps track of the median for a stream of numbers, updating the median for each new number. The second part of the coding challenge is to implement a running median for the number of words per line of text. Consider each line in a text file as a new stream of words, and find the median number of words per line, up to that point (i.e. the median for that line and all the previous lines).
